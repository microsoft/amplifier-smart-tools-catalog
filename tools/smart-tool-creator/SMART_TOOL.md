  Creates, validates, and evaluates smart tools that follow the Amplifier Smart Tool
  Spec. Use when you want to package domain expertise as a smart tool, check that an
  existing one conforms to the spec, or measure how well its smart capabilities work.
use_cases:
  - Scaffold a new smart tool that is ready to push and conforms to the spec
  - Check an existing smart tool against the spec and its conformance kit
  - Build and run evaluations for a smart tool's model-backed capabilities
platforms:
  - linux
  - macos
  - windows
requires:
  - name: gh
    purpose: >
      Generates the token that signs in to GitHub Copilot. Without it, the model-backed
      capabilities cannot authenticate.
    optional: true
    install: https://cli.github.com/
  - name: github-copilot-subscription
    purpose: >
      A Copilot subscription on the account signed in to gh powers the model-backed
      capabilities. Without it, only the deterministic capabilities run.
    optional: true
    install: https://github.com/github/copilot-cli#prerequisites
  - name: prek
    purpose: >
      Runs the lint and format checks of the tool being extended by add-smart-capability.
      Without it that check is skipped.

A smart tool for building smart tools. It scaffolds the structure the
[spec](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-smart-tools) requires, checks a tool against
the spec, and evaluates the tool's model-backed capabilities in isolation.

**The library is the tool.** `smart_tool_creator.lib` holds every capability. The CLI is a
thin wrapper over it, so anything you can do from the shell you can also do from Python.

## When to reach for it

- You have domain expertise in a harness, a bundle, or a set of skills and want to share it
  as a standalone tool that any agent can call.
- You built a smart tool and want to know whether it conforms to the spec before publishing it.
- You want evidence that a smart tool's model-backed capabilities work, independent of the
  harness that calls it.

## Before writing code

Confirm every capability and argument against `smart-tool-creator <command> --help` before
using it. Do not fill gaps from memory. The library source beside this file, `lib.py`,
carries the signatures. The repository's `docs/01-library.md` and `docs/02-cli.md` carry the
rest.

## Install

```bash
# as a CLI
uv tool install git+https://github.com/DavidKoleczek/amplifier-smart-tool-creator

# as a library
uv add "amplifier-smart-tool-creator @ git+https://github.com/DavidKoleczek/amplifier-smart-tool-creator"

# once, without installing
uvx --from git+https://github.com/DavidKoleczek/amplifier-smart-tool-creator smart-tool-creator --help
```

Verify with `smart-tool-creator manifest`, which needs no credentials.

## Prerequisites

Deterministic capabilities need only `uv`. Model-backed capabilities run through GitHub
Copilot, signed in as the GitHub CLI's user: `gh` must be installed and `gh auth login`
completed with an account that has a Copilot subscription. Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Straight and smart paths

Deterministic capabilities run with no provider configured. Model-backed capabilities go
through GitHub Copilot, signed in as the GitHub CLI's user, and say so in their help text.
A model-backed capability with nothing configured fails immediately and names what to set;
it never falls back to a deterministic answer.

## Scaffolding a new smart tool

`init` creates a git repository (no remote) holding a tool that already passes the
conformance kit: manifest, descriptor, library, thin CLI, docs, tests, an `AGENTS.md`
carrying the spec's principles, and a gitignored `reference/` with shallow clones of the
spec and the SDK to read while developing. The environment is synced and the first commit is
made. Deterministic, but needs network for `uv sync` and the clones.

```bash
smart-tool-creator init incident-postmortem --description "Writes, reviews, and tracks blameless postmortems from your incident platform's records" --skill --repository https://github.com/org/incident-postmortem
```

```python
from smart_tool_creator.lib import init

scaffold = init(
    "incident-postmortem",
    "Writes, reviews, and tracks blameless postmortems from your incident platform's records",
    skill=True,
    repository="https://github.com/org/incident-postmortem",
)
scaffold.root, scaffold.files, scaffold.references, scaffold.output_message
```

Pick a slug name (lowercase, digits, hyphens) and a one-sentence description that says what
the tool is for; both land in the manifest. `--directory` chooses where it goes, default
`./<name>`, which must not exist or must be empty. `--skill` also writes
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. `--repository <url>` names where the tool will live: it is
declared in `pyproject.toml`, every install instruction uses `git+<url>`, and it becomes
the `origin` remote, though nothing is pushed. Without it, `https://github.com/<owner>/<name>`
stands in and the install instructions do not work until it is replaced and the tool is
pushed; the result's `output_message` says so. Language and intelligence layer default to
`uv-python` and `copilot-sdk`.

Afterwards, work inside the new repository, following the next steps in the result's `output_message`:
read its `AGENTS.md`, fill in `docs/00-vision.md` and, if the surface is already clear,
`docs/01-library.md`, then add domain capabilities to its library and run the conformance
kit as its `CONTRIBUTING.md` describes. The docs come first because they set the stage for
everything implemented; keep them concise and written for people. Pushing is the user's
call, as is creating the remote and replacing the placeholder when `--repository` was not given.

## Adding a smart capability

`add-smart-capability` extends a smart tool that already exists: an agent reads the tool,
implements one model-backed capability in its library, exposes it from the CLI, writes the
tests and the docs, then runs the tool's own checks (`uv run pytest`, the conformance kit,
and `prek run --all-files` when `prek` is installed) and fixes what they report. Nothing is
committed; the working tree is left for you to review. Model-backed.

```bash
smart-tool-creator add-smart-capability \
  "Given an incident id, fetch its chat transcript and alert timeline from the incident platform and draft a blameless postmortem: summary, impact, contributing factors, and action items with owners" \
  --directory ~/src/incident-postmortem \
  --context "The platform client is src/incident_postmortem/platform.py; fetch through it, never call the API directly" \
  --context "Our postmortem template is at ~/notes/postmortem-template.md; match its headings"
```

```python
from pathlib import Path

from smart_tool_creator.lib import add_smart_capability

added = add_smart_capability(
    "Given an incident id, fetch its chat transcript and alert timeline from the incident platform "
    "and draft a blameless postmortem: summary, impact, contributing factors, and action items with owners",
    directory=Path("~/src/incident-postmortem").expanduser(),
    context=[
        "The platform client is src/incident_postmortem/platform.py; fetch through it, never call the API directly",
        "Our postmortem template is at ~/notes/postmortem-template.md; match its headings",
    ],
)
added.report, added.checks, added.fix_rounds, added.output_message
```

The request is the whole brief: what the capability does, for whom, and what it takes in and
gives back. `--directory` names the tool to work in, the current directory when omitted; it
must hold a `smart-tool.json`, so scaffold with `init` first. `--context` is repeatable free
text, usually paths to notes, transcripts, or exemplars the agent should read before it
designs anything; it reads them itself, so name them rather than pasting them. `--model` and
`--reasoning-effort` pick the agent behind it.

The result carries the agent's report, one entry per check, how many extra rounds were spent
fixing them, and an `output_message` carrying all of it for the calling agent, which is what the
CLI prints. A check still failing when the work stops is named in the message and exits 1.

## Output and failure contract

Results go to stdout, diagnostics to stderr. A failure prints a message naming what went
wrong and how to fix it, and exits non-zero: 1 for a failure the tool can name, 2 for a bad
invocation. Never treat an empty result as success.

## Choosing a surface

Import the library from Python. Shell out to the CLI from anything that cannot import Python
in-process: a shell script, a CI job, or an agent that can run commands but not load a Python
object. Both reach the same capabilities.

To chain capabilities, here or with other smart tools, write a script against the libraries
and pass return values between calls. The CLI's text output is for reading, not for parsing.
