version: 0.9.0
description: >
  Takes things someone has asserted and checks each one against evidence, returning a verdict per claim -- supported, refuted, unverifiable or opinion -- with the sources each rests on. Reach for it when the ask sounds like "is any of this actually true?", "check the claims in this draft before it goes out", "he says X, is that right?", "which parts of this hold up?", or "where did that number come from?". Claims are checked INDEPENDENTLY, so one false claim does not condemn the rest of a document, and a single verdict can be audited down to the sources under it. Use it on a draft before it ships, on a page or a transcript full of assertions, or to re-check claims against evidence an earlier research run already gathered. Do NOT use it for an open question with no claim in it yet -- that is deep-research -- or to check code against its tests.
use_cases:
  - Check the claims in a document or a draft before it goes out
  - Find which of several assertions actually hold, and which merely sound right
  - Audit a single verdict down to the sources it rests on
  - Re-check claims against evidence a previous research run already gathered
platforms:
  - linux
  - macos
requires:
  - name: perplexity
    purpose: >
      A PERPLEXITY_API_KEY in the environment, or a perplexity entry in
      ~/.config/amplifier-research/credentials.toml at mode 0600. It supplies the evidence
      claims are checked against. Without it the check verb fails saying so rather than
      guessing, so what is lost is checking new claims; verdicts already on disk stay
      readable. Run `fact-check check` to see whether this host has it. The SDK is not
      listed here: it ships as a resolved dependency.
    optional: true
    install: docs/CONFIGURATION.md
  - name: ai-provider
    purpose: >
      Backs the stages that sort claims by type and weigh evidence against each one.
      Without it no claim can be checked and the verb refuses rather than guessing, so
      what is lost is checking itself; reading, filtering and re-rendering runs that
      already exist keeps working. Any one of ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY,
      GOOGLE_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY or AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY satisfies it. This tool
      stores no credentials of its own.

# fact-check

One library, one thin `fact-check` CLI. Every response is a single JSON document on
stdout; failures are a JSON error envelope carrying `code`, `message` and `remedy`, with
a non-zero exit. Diagnostics and progress go to stderr.

## What it is good at

Taking several claims and telling you which hold. Each claim is checked independently and
carries its own verdict, confidence, reasoning and sources, so a single verdict can be
audited without reading the rest. A completed run is a directory on disk, and reading or
re-rendering it costs nothing and needs no credential.

It shares an evidence store with `deep-research`: a check can be run against sources a
research run already gathered rather than gathering them again.

## What it is deliberately bad at

It does not find claims -- it checks the ones it is given. It does not rate a document
overall, because "mostly true" is the kind of summary that hides which part was false.

`unverifiable` is a real verdict, not a failure: it means the claim was checked and no
adequate evidence was found either way. It is never reported as `refuted`.

## Straight and smart paths

`manifest` is deterministic and runs with no provider configured. The model-backed verbs
consume tokens, may answer differently on a second run, and fail saying so when nothing
is configured.

This version ships the manifest verb only; the verbs named in `contracts/cli.v1.md`
arrive next.
