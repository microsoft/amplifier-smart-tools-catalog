version: 0.9.0
description: >
  Researches a question across many sources and comes back with a short brief plus the citations behind it. Reach for it when the ask sounds like "what do we actually know about X?", "find me sources on this", "is this approach still the consensus?", "what are the options here and who says so?", or "I need to decide this and I have not read anything yet". Searches the live web, reads what it finds, and synthesises -- the answer is a brief plus a pointer to the full evidence kept on disk, so a result too large to hold in one reply can still be navigated, re-read and answered against later. Use it before committing to a decision, to get a short answer with its sources attached without reading them first, or to build a durable evidence record. Do NOT use it to check specific claims you already have -- that is fact-check -- or for questions answerable from the code or documents already in front of you.
use_cases:
  - Find out what is actually known about a question before committing to a decision
  - Get a short answer with the sources behind it, without reading the sources first
  - Build a durable evidence record that later questions can be answered against
  - Produce a bibliography for a topic without collecting the references by hand
platforms:
  - linux
  - macos
requires:
  - name: perplexity
    purpose: >
      A PERPLEXITY_API_KEY in the environment, or a perplexity entry in
      ~/.config/amplifier-research/credentials.toml at mode 0600. It supplies the evidence
      a research run is built from. Without it the research verb fails saying so rather
      than returning a lesser answer, so what is lost is the gathering of new evidence;
      every run already on disk stays readable. Run `deep-research check` to see whether
      this host has it. The SDK is not listed here: it ships as a resolved dependency.
    optional: true
    install: docs/CONFIGURATION.md
  - name: ai-provider
    purpose: >
      Backs the reasoning stages that scope a question and synthesise the gathered
      evidence. Without it the research verb refuses rather than degrading, so what is
      lost is research itself; every deterministic verb -- reading, filtering,
      re-rendering and listing runs that already exist -- keeps working. Any one of
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY or
      AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY satisfies it. This tool stores no credentials of its own.

# deep-research

One library, one thin `deep-research` CLI. Every response is a single JSON document on
stdout; failures are a JSON error envelope carrying `code`, `message` and `remedy`, with
a non-zero exit. Diagnostics and progress go to stderr.

## What it is good at

Answering a question that needs more than one source, and leaving behind evidence that
outlives the call. A completed run is a directory on disk: the brief, the full report,
the normalised sources, and the raw backend responses. Reading, filtering and re-rendering
that directory costs nothing and needs no credential, so an expensive answer is paid for
once and consulted freely.

## What it is deliberately bad at

It is not a search engine and does not index the web. It is not a citation manager. It
does not decide that a question has one true answer -- where the evidence disagrees, the
brief says so, and confidence is stated rather than implied.

## Straight and smart paths

`manifest` is deterministic and runs with no provider configured. The model-backed verbs
consume tokens, may answer differently on a second run, and fail saying so when nothing
is configured.

This version ships the manifest verb only; the research and navigation verbs named in
`contracts/cli.v1.md` arrive next.
